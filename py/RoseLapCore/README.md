# Roselap v4
Welcome to RoseLap, a moderately powerful laptime simulation tool used by Rose-Hulman Institue of Technology's FSAE team, Rose Grand Prix Engineering (GPE). We use this software to turn vehicle parameters into theoretical lap times, as well as perform studies to examine the effects of variations in parameters on track performance. From that data we can then make better-informed design decisions.

Check out the model documentation in model_docs.tex.

RoseLap will soon be acessible via a web interface, which includes various plotting and analysis tools.
