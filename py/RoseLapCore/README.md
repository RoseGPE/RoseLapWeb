# Roselap v4 Core
Welcome to RoseLap, a moderately powerful laptime simulation tool used by Rose-Hulman Institue of Technology's FSAE team, Rose Grand Prix Engineering (GPE). We use this software to turn vehicle parameters into theoretical lap times, as well as perform studies to examine the effects of variations in parameters on track performance. From that data we can then make better-informed design decisions.

RoseLap will soon be acessible via a web interface, which includes various plotting and analysis tools.

## Getting Acquainted

- [Check out the model documentation in model_docs.pdf](model_docs.pdf)

While the web interface is in progress...

- [Check out the vehicle example in params/vehicles/START_HERE.yaml](./params/vehicles/START_HERE.yaml)
- [Check out the library of tracks in params/tracks](./params/tracks)
- [Check out the study example in STUDY_START_HERE.yaml](./STUDY_START_HERE.yaml)
