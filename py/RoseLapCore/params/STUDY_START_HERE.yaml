### Study Example and Tutorial ###
# Welcome to the big deal with lapsim: studies (AKA sweeps, AKA batches)!

##### BATCH CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE ####

##### INPUT SPECIFICATION #####
# Specify which vehicle you'd like to use as a baseline
vehicle: VEHICLE_START_HERE.yaml 

# Specify which model to use in this study.
# You should select the model with the least tires possible to capture the effects of the parameters to study.
model: one_tire 

# Specify a list of tracks to run on.
tracks:
  - file: acceleration.dxf      # the definition file
    segment_distance: 0.2       # the size of segments to use
    steady_state: false         # whether or not to use steady state conditions (expensive as it requires running a sim to the end and re-launching. Generally, don't do this)
    point_formula: acceleration # what type of track this is in the FSAE event
    min_time: 4.1               # the minimum time for this track at an FSAE event (to get scores right)

  - file: skidpad_loop.dxf
    segment_distance: 0.2
    steady_state: false
    point_formula: skidpad
    min_time: 5.2

  - file: ne_2015_endurance.svg
    segment_distance: 0.2
    steady_state: false
    point_formula: endurance
    min_time: 52.0
    min_co2: 0.2202 # for endurance scoring (not endurance_noeff scoring), the minimum amount of co2 produced by a team on endurance


##### TEST SPECIFICATION #####
# Specify how to vary parameters.
# This is a 2-d study. If only one axis entry is provided, that's as much as we will get.
tests:
  - axis: # This is the X-axis
    # An axis can have multiple values.
    # This allows you to sweep through engine packages by varying both weight and power. That is what this sweep will do.

    - target: engine_torque # This is the vehicle parameter to target
      operation: replace    # We will replace the baseline parameter with the specified value
      test_vals:            # This is a list of parameters that we will vary
        - [14.3, 16.2, 17.4, 16.5, 15.5, 13.8, 13.9]
        - [24.3, 26.2, 27.4, 26.5, 25.5, 23.8, 23.9]
        - [34.3, 36.2, 37.4, 36.5, 35.5, 33.8, 33.9]
    - target: mass
      operation: product         # for this target, we will multiply the baseline parameter by the specified values.
      test_vals: [0.8, 1.0, 1.2] # these are the values that we will multiply by. (bracketed lists are as much of lists as dashed lists like above.)

  - axis: # This is the Y-axis
    - target: downforce_35mph
      operation: replace
      test_vals:
        # This is a weird exception to the YAML spec that we have defined for convenience.
        # This generates the list 0,10,20,...,80 automatically! Very useful for big sweeps.
        range_start: 0
        range_end: 80
        range_step: 10
