### Starter Vehicle File ###
# An example vehicle to help you get started in creating a vehicle; basically RGP007
# units are lbf, ft, s
# updated 7/2/2018

### Getting started ###
# A vehicle definition file contains the baseline parameters of a vehicle.
# This file is written in YAML ('YAML Aint Markup Language').
# If you are confused by the syntax, https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml is an easy reference.

### Aerodynamics ###
# The first in the list is the number in the 'full' or default configuration,
# second is 'DRS' condition,
# third is 'airbrake' configuration.
# To 'omit' a configuration, simply make the values the same as the 'full' configuration.

downforce_35mph: [61.0, 61.0, 61.0] # lbf - the downforce produced at 35 MPH
drag_35mph:      [40.0, 40.0, 40.0] # lbf - the drag produced at 35 MPH
cp_height: [0.9, 0.9, 0.9]          # ft - the height of the center of pressure
cp_bias:   [0.4, 0.4, 0.4]          # fraction - the amount of the downforce that acts on the front tires

### Tires ###
# See the RoseLap documentation for explanation of these values.
# The front and rear tires are used for the two- and four- tire models.
# The lumped tire is used for the onetire (aka pointmass) model.

## Front Tires ##
# Longitudinal Parameters
front_tire_mu_x: 2.90   # lbf/lbf
front_tire_offset_x: 33.99 # lbf
# Lateral Parameters
front_tire_mu_y: 2.0050   # lbf/lbf
front_tire_offset_y: 45.0 # lbf
# Tire radius
front_tire_radius: 0.75   # ft

## Rear Tires ##
# Longitudinal Forces
rear_tire_mu_x: 2.8196
rear_tire_offset_x: 33.99
# Lateral Forces
rear_tire_mu_y: 2.0050
rear_tire_offset_y: 45.0
# Tire radius
rear_tire_radius: 0.75

## Lumped Tire ##
# Longitudinal Forces
comb_tire_mu_x: 2.8196
comb_tire_offset_x: 33.99
# Lateral Forces
comb_tire_mu_y: 2.0050
comb_tire_offset_y: 45.0
# Tire radius - make this the rear tire radius (used for gear ratio calcs)
comb_tire_radius: 0.75

### Suspension / Chassis ###

## Roll stiffnesses ##
lltd: perfect # can be 'perfect' or a value
k_roll_front: 183.0 # ft-lbf / deg - the roll stiffness of the front suspension
k_roll_rear:  317.0 # ft-lbf / deg - the roll stiffness of the rear suspension
k_chassis:    2000.0 # ft-lbf / deg - the roll stiffness of the chassis


## Mass Parameters ##
# Note: as long as we use imperial units, lbm is used, but internally, the value is converted to slugs.
mass: 570      # lbm - The overall mass of the vehicle including driver and turbo
moi_yaw: 1620  # lbm*ft^2 - The overall moment of inertia including driver about the vertical axis passing through the CG.
cg_height: 0.9 # ft - The height of the center of gravity from the ground at static height

## Size Parameters ##
wheelbase_length: 5 # ft - The length of the wheelbase
weight_bias: 0.45   # fraction - the amount of weight that is on the front tires
track_front: 4.5    # ft - the track width of the front tires
track_rear:  4.4    # ft - the track width of the rear tires
r_add: 0 # ft - additional radius that can be employed to make a turn. This allows us to see the impact of increasing/decreasing track width on tightness of turns.

### Brakes ###

perfect_brake_bias: true # boolean - if true, brake bias is set 'perfectly' so all available grip is used. If false, brake_bias is used.
brake_bias: 0.67         # fraction - the amount of braking force to have on the front tires compared to total braking force

### Engine ###
# An engine curve given by two lists.
engine_rpms: [4000.0, 4500.0, 5000.0, 5500.0, 6000.0, 6500.0, 7000.0, 7500.0, 8000.0, 8500.0, 9000.0, 9500.0]
engine_torque: [24.0, 25.0, 27.0, 33.0, 36.0, 35.0, 37.0, 39.0, 37.0, 36.0, 33.0, 32.0]

# Correlated efficiency factors for 100 Octane gasoline
co2_factor: 2.31 #kg/L - The amount of CO2 produced per liter of fuel consumed
e_factor: 3.5e6 #ft*lbf/L - The amount of useful mechanical energy produced per liter of fuel consumed

### Transmission ###
# Note: overall transmission ratio is calculated as engine_reduction*gear[gear_no]*final_drive_reduction
engine_reduction: 2.81 # ratio - A reduction applied to all gears
gears:    # ratio - a list of reductions available to the driver (any number of gears can be specified)
  - 2.416
  - 1.92
  - 1.562
  - 1.277
  - 1.05
final_drive_reduction: 2.70 # ratio - the final drive reduction

shift_time: 0.2 # s - the time taken to complete a shift
