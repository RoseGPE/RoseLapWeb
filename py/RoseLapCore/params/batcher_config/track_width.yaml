### Study Example and Tutorial ###
# Welcome to the big deal with lapsim: studies (AKA sweeps, AKA batches)!
##### BATCH CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE ####
##### INPUT SPECIFICATION #####
# Specify which vehicle you'd like to use as a baseline
vehicle: VEHICLE_START_HERE.yaml 
# Specify which model to use in this study.
# You should select the model with the least tires possible to capture the effects of the parameters to study.
model: one_tire 
# Specify a list of tracks to run on.
tracks:
  - file: acceleration.dxf      # the definition file
    segment_distance: 0.2       # the size of segments to use
    steady_state: false         # whether or not to use steady state conditions (expensive as it requires running a sim to the end and re-launching. Generally, don't do this)
    point_formula: acceleration # what type of track this is in the FSAE event
    min_time: 4.1               # the minimum time for this track at an FSAE event (to get scores right)
  - file: skidpad_loop.dxf
    segment_distance: 0.2
    steady_state: false
    point_formula: skidpad
    min_time: 4.8
  - file: mi_2018_endurance.svg
    segment_distance: 0.2
    steady_state: false
    point_formula: endurance
    min_time:
  - file: mi_2018_autox.svg
    segment_distance: 0.2
    steady_state: false
    point_formula: autox
    min_time: 
    
##### TEST SPECIFICATION #####
# Specify how to vary parameters.
# This is a 2-d study. If only one axis entry is provided, that's as much as we will get.
tests:
  - axis: # This is the X-axis
    # An axis can have multiple values.
    # This allows you to sweep through engine packages by varying both weight and power. That is what this sweep will do.
