#Usage
Tire data should go in a folder named 'data'. This is NOT provided as it would be a copyright breach. Please consult your Technical Director for how to obtain tire data from the TTC (or other sources).

Things labeled USERDEF are intended to be modified by the user, and you will likely want to do this. This is not a fully automated process.
