_the future is now_

Backend
- Pure python; rewrite everything in web.py
- Pure data; no precompiled plots
-- Should we use databases still? Same DB backend?
- Batcher needs some serious revamping
- Working with any version of python would be good
- One-time import of old data OK? 
- 1D sweeps are just 2D sweeps?

Frontend
- Pure data; no precompiled plots
-- Could use d3, or could use Thad's splot
- Detail views on the same area as heat maps
-- Better yet, two detail views side-by-side beneath heatmap

Model Changes
- Rolling resistance
- Proper integration of electric motor options

Overall
- Be better; document what's going on for future use
- Don't be afraid to blow things up and refactor
